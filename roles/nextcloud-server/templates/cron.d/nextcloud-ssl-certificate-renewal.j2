# The goal of this cronjob is to ask acmetool to check
# the current SSL certificates and to see if some need renewal.
# If so, it would attempt to renew.
#
# Various services depend on these certificates and would need to be restarted.
# This is not our concern here. We simply make sure the certificates are up to date.
# Restarting of services happens on its own different schedule (other cronjobs).
